        <h2 class="mb-5">Biography</h2>
        <p>Originally a South Dakota-native, I moved to Portland 5 years ago after completing a BS in English.
          <br>
          <br>
          I had the opportunity while studying at Black Hills State University to work a series of meaningful jobs that have helped inform my passions and future goals.
          For two years, I worked at the Sturgis Public Library, assisting patrons navigate library resources, hosting computer classes, and creating new programs to draw in additional community members.
          From this job I learned the value of community and providing access to information, regardless of socioeconomic class.
          <br>
          <br>
          While working at the library, I also worked as an intern for the South Dakota Library Network (SDLN). SDLN provided technical support for the collection software public and academic libraries across the state of South Dakota shared.
          While I primarily worked with other staff members on specific projects, performing weekly record loads, and updating reference websites, I also had the fantastic opportunity to design and execute two research projects investigating fiction circulation trends across the state. 
          I was able to present at the National Conference of Undergraduate Research Conference, BHSU's Research Symposium, and the South Dakota Library Association Tri-Conference of 2013.
          <br>
          <br>
          After graduating, I had two short term jobs, one as a supervisor at Rushmore Cave and one as a generalist for Powell's Books at Cedar Hills Crossing after moving to Portland. These positions both taught me how to stay calm and professional during times of high traffic.
          They also taught me strong organizational skills as I coordinated tour schedules at the cave and provided assistance during Powell's events (the largest was when Cary Elwes came in December 2014 -- 2,000 people arrived at the store!)
          <br>
          <br>
          Since March of 2015, I've worked for Lions VisionGift, a non-profit dedicated to restoring sight through corneal transplants and research. This has easily been one of the most transformative opportunities I've had.
          It's been a privilege to learn about human medicine in reviewing patient's medical records for donation eligibility and speak with families on arguably one of the worst days of their lives. I've learned skills
          in maintaining professionalism when speaking with frustrated people (both from the families and from stressed-out hospital staff). It's also taught me a lot of compassion and how to communicate effectively. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Two years ago I became the supervisor of our referral center, which has continued to teach me many valuable lessons. This position has not only taught me how to maintain longterm professional relationships, it has also exposed me to software project management and data analytics.
          <br>
          <br>
          I started the University of Oregon's Coding Bootcamp because I realized I was ready to transition into the next stage of my career. We have implemented several important projects over the last two years focused on new softwares and improving processes. Our most recent implementation
          was for a referral center software, and I must admit, I fell in love with the entire product implementation process. I want to transition into a product manager position where I can act as a liasion between the client and the develolpment team, helping to ensure a seamless transition to a new software.
          I'm incredibly grateful for all of my experiences and how they have continued to teach me how to work effectively in teams. I'm looking forward to the opportunity to work with a new team in a new capacity and continue learning and growing in my career.
